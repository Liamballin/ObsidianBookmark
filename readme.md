# A Chrome extension and nodejs server to allow web clipping to Obsidian.

The extension copies highlight areas of a web page to markdown, and sends it to a local node server. This then saves it as a markdown file in a folder, like an Obsidian vault, the user has chosen.

Until Obsidian supports adding new notes through their custom `Obsidian://` URL protocol, this might be the best way. 

Inspired by jplattel's [Obsidian clipper](https://github.com/jplattel/obsidian-clipper) - a much less janky solution.
